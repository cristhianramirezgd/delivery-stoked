          <p class="margin-bottom-paragraph">At Stoked Delivery, we are revolutionizing the food delivery industry by providing an innovative marketplace that creates social and economic value.</p>
          <h3 class="text-red-color bold margin-bottom-title">The challenge.</h3>
          <p class="margin-bottom-paragraph">Consumers today are paying more than ever for their food deliveries, while merchants continue to pay these platforms 20%-30% of their order revenue. Additionally, these marketplace apps may apply higher fees, use opaque markups, and drivers may not receive as much remuneration as they deserve.</p>
          <h3 class="text-red-color bold margin-bottom-title">Stoked Delivery addresses these issues and offers an alternative.</h3>
          <p class="margin-bottom-paragraph">We believe that everyone should have access to healthy and delicious food, and our platform provides merchants with the tools that they need to succeed. With a flat 5% commission fee and no hidden costs, Stoked Delivery is the most affordable and innovative food delivery service in the industry.</p>

      <p>Stoked offers more than just food delivery. We aim to enhance the food delivery business model by providing a solution that allows local communities to grow and thrive in a transparent economy.</p>
      <p class="text-red-color bold margin-bottom-title">The Stoked ecosystem has 5 guiding principles:</p>
      <p class="margin-bottom">Everyone gets their piece of the pie because our technology is built by people for people.</p>
      <ol class="custom-list margin-bottom">
        <li><p>Restaurants and drivers should receive the highest possible returns.</p></li>
        <li><p>Provide restaurants with a reduced platform fee.</p></li>
        <li><p>Never charge a fee on delivery drivers’ tips and provide rapid access to cash.</p></li>
        <li><p>Reduce fees for the customers and remove opaque markups.</p></li>
        <li><p>Support kitchen staff with a 2% tip on every order.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p class="margin-bottom">As we grow, the Stoked Community will be adding additional benefits to our ecosystem to bring dominion back to the merchants and drivers, who are the most active participants in food delivery, so stay tuned and be a part of the change.</p>
